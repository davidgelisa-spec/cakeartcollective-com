        I'm Lisa, and I've been making cakes for over a decade. What started as curiosity turned into a career — designing, sculpting, and finishing every cake by hand.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text-secondary text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Every cake I make is designed from scratch. I work closely with each customer to understand what they're after, whether that's an elegant tiered wedding cake, a sculpted birthday cake, or something completely unexpected. No two are ever the same.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text-secondary text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I'm also passionate about teaching. My classes are for anyone who wants to learn — complete beginners, keen home bakers, or people looking for a creative experience. I keep groups small so everyone gets proper attention.

        <p class="text-primary-light/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The best cakes come from really listening. I want to know about your occasion, the people, the details that matter to you. That's where the design starts.
        </p>
        <p class="text-primary-light/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          I care about quality in everything: the ingredients, the finish, the flavour. A cake should taste as good as it looks.
